## General Information
This project was developed by me while I was learning UiPath in the initial stages. The robot generates a popup on the screen that accepts a city name from the user. Then the robot looks up the weather of the city in the internet and depending upon it, gives a suitable clothing suggestion to the user on the screen.


## Technologies Used
- UiPath Studio


## Setup
UiPath Studio needs to be installed. Install UiPath from the official page from the link [here](https://www.uipath.com/). Since the robot runs on Google Chrome, please ensure that the aforementioned browser is also installed on your system.


## Usage
Once the robot is triggered from the UiPath studio, a popup will appear on the screen where the user will be asked to type in the city's name. Once that is done, the robot will open the browser, look for the weather of the city in Celsius (Â°C) and display another popup on the screen with the clothing suggestions.


## Project Status
Project is: _Complete_
